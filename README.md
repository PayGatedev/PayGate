# ⚡PayGate⚡

A platform for all creators and all content. Watch your favorite creators in a Web3-native, closed community. Everything you've been looking for — in one single app: Guides, Videos, Articles, and Podcasts — without needing to pay separately for four different apps. Watch and support your creators here.

> **For Creators**

Gather your audience in one app without having to grow separate channels across multiple platforms. Monetize with NFT passes, monthly subscriptions, and one-time purchases. Collaborate with others to create top-tier content, and get paid through transparent Solana smart contracts.
